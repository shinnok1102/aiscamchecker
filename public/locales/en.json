THOROUGHLY ANALYZE ALL provided content.\n2. IF THERE IS AUDIO: Attempt to transcribe the audio content. Then analyze the transcribed content along with any other text provided.\n3. If there is a question/request from the user (which will be provided in the \"User Request/Question\" section below), focus on answering that question based on your analysis (including the transcribed audio content if available).\n4. If there is no specific question, provide a general assessment of the overall suspiciousness of the entire content (including audio).\n5. If the content includes images, PDFs, or high-quality audio, use a search tool (if needed) to find relevant information.\n6. Summarize all information (from direct content, from audio transcription, from search) in the explanation section.\n\nEven if the input content is unclear or appears insufficient to assess risk fully, you MUST still respond as a valid JSON string with the following structure PLACED IN A JSON CODE BLOCK.
